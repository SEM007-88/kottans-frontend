### My study log

# 12 October 2020 
## 0 Stage 
Today I've finished both git courses related to git. 
This helped me a lot to refresh my git knowledge because as usual I use a few basic git commands
and almost forgot how to implement them.
The 1st course (from Udacity) was quite simple. 
The 2nd one (from try.github.io) was a little bit tricky especially in the advance section.
Hopefully I've managed to complete them both, screenshots are attached. 
Although I didn't clarify some git advanced commands 100% but wrote them down to dive deeper when I'll encount them.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

Today I've refreshed my Linux CLI and HTTP knowledge. 
As weel created my personal engineer-wiki in Notion. 
It's gonna help me to structure my knowledge and reveal the most important parts when needed. 

Also I've read 2 HTTP articles. I grasped the main concepts, however some details are really hard to understand at this point. 
My plan is to move futher to complete the main tasks but definetly come back after that to accomplish all optional tasks to get better understanding.

This one was definitly a good refresher. 
In addition I higly improved my @media understanding.
It was a great practice to adjust the layout of different sections of website in lessons 4 & 5 in task 1. 
Definitly will implement "Off Canvas" responsive design pattern in my next project. 
I've tried it for the 1st time in this task and it was truly great! 

# 18 October 2020 

Today I've started my first study project - pop-up menu, developed using only html and css. 
I've already did layout part and toggle state. 
Writing it without JS was a little bit challenging but definitly improved my CSS skill. 

# 19 October 2020 

Today I didn't have that much to code but anyway dedicated some time and almost finished my pop-up menu project.
It's approximately 90% done. 
Just some polishing work and moving forward. 
Today I've reviwed so much stuff! 
And learn new as well. 
I'm pretty excited about this exercise!
