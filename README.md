### My study log

# 12 October 2020 
## 0 Stage 
Today I've finished both git courses related to git. 
This helped me a lot to refresh my git knowledge because as usual I use a few basic git commands
and almost forgot how to implement them.
The 1st course (from Udacity) was quite simple. 
The 2nd one (from try.github.io) was a little bit tricky especially in the advance section.
Hopefully I've managed to complete them both, screenshots are attached. 
Although I didn't clarify some git advanced commands 100% but wrote them down to dive deeper when I'll encount them.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

Today I've refreshed my Linux CLI and HTTP knowledge. 
As weel created my personal engineer-wiki in Notion. 
It's gonna help me to structure my knowledge and reveal the most important parts when needed. 

Also I've read 2 HTTP articles. I grasped the main concepts, however some details are really hard to understand at this point. 
My plan is to move futher to complete the main tasks but definetly come back after that to accomplish all optional tasks to get better understanding.

especially `git rebase`

I've refreshed my CSS knowledge a little bit, especially css transitions section. 
I'm going to implement the cool chained transition with my next animated element.

## Responsive Web Design

This one was definitly a good refresher. 
In addition I higly improved my @media understanding.
It was a great practice to adjust the layout of different sections of website in lessons 4 & 5 in task 1. 
Definitly will implement "Off Canvas" responsive design pattern in my next project. 
I've tried it for the 1st time in this task and it was truly great! 

# 18 October 2020 

Today I've started my first study project - pop-up menu, developed using only html and css. 
I've already did layout part and toggle state. 
Writing it without JS was a little bit challenging but definitly improved my CSS skill. 

# 19 October 2020 

Today I didn't have that much to code but anyway dedicated some time and almost finished my pop-up menu project.
It's approximately 90% done. 
Just some polishing work and moving forward. 
Today I've reviwed so much stuff! 
And learn new as well. 
I'm pretty excited about this exercise!

# 20 October 2020 

Pop-up task finished 98%
Trying to figure out for a long time how to implement TAB into sub-menu.

# 21-29 October 2020

I didn't write here for all these days however I've been coding/stydying every single day. 
For this period of time I've completed Pop-up task and finished Javascript section (read about this below) 
Working on this project I've learned so much new HTML/CSS stuff! 
Something from the list: 
- You should check you project in https://validator.w3.org/ (validator)
- BEM methodology (before I've been writing chaotic classes in HTML and selectors in CSS without any structure. Now I know the right way to follow!!)
- :before :after <- extremly useful!
- z-index <- one more important thing into my knowledge base 
- pop-up element implementation with :checked - this was really cool to learn!
- adding empty lines at the end of the file
- some unofficial rule of creating header navigation is to use such structure header>ul>li>a
- and many-many more!! 
I really appreciate all the feedback from mentors that helped me to learn new stuff and become better!

After finishing this section I've realized that before my JS knowledge was pretty weak, mostly theoretical and just with a little practical background.
Tasks from codeacademy (epsecially Intermidiate Algorythms) helped me a lot to improve my undesrtanding and confidence. 
Tasks from Intermidiate Algorythms I even did 2 times to better understand and remember ways to solve different kind of problems. 

I've learned a lot about RegExp!! Before it was something mystical for me and I was a litlle bit afraid of it.
But now, after completing tasks related to RegExp and learning/practicing them for several hours I feel much-much more confident and can operate them without any problems.
It's so cool to learn and finally understand some complex topic! Yuhuuuu!
