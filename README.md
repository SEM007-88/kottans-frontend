## My study log

### 12 October 2020 


0 Stage -  âœ…
Today I've finished both git courses related to git. 
This helped me a lot to refresh my git knowledge because as usual I use a few basic git commands
and almost forgot how to implement them.
The 1st course (from Udacity) was quite simple. 
The 2nd one (from try.github.io) was a little bit tricky especially in the advance section.
Hopefully I've managed to complete them both, screenshots are attached. 
Although I didn't clarify some git advanced commands 100% but wrote them down to dive deeper when I'll encount them.
